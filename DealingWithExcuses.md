## 1. The Clumsy Ludo Player

You are playing a game of online Ludo with your girlfriend along with another couple during the COVID-19 lockdown. Your girlfriend and you have publicly pre-committed to the tit-for-tat strategy - you'll cooperate with her as long as she remains cooperative and punish any actions she takes against you with an action against her. This seems prudent, as you know your girlfriend has a competitive streak and hates to lose.

By the time your third piece is out of home base, you're going happily along, raking up the bonuses of cooperation and dominating the other couple, when your girlfriend unexpectedly captures one of your pieces.

"Uh, sorry," she says "My finger slipped."

"I still have to punish you just in case," you say "I'm going to capture one of your pieces next turn, and we'll see how you like it."

"Well," says your girlfriend, "knowing that, I guess I'll make a move against you next turn too, and we'll both lose out. But hey, it was just a slipped finger. By not trusting me, you're costing us both the benefits of one turn of cooperation."

"True", you respond "but if I don't do it, you'll feel free to screw me over whenever you feel like it, using the 'my finger slipped' excuse."

"How about this?" proposes your girlfriend. "I promise to take extra care that my finger won't slip again. You promise that if my finger does slip again, you will punish me terribly, moving against me for a bunch of turns. That way, we trust each other again, and we can still get the benefits of cooperation next turn."

You don't believe that your girlfriend's finger really slipped, not for an instant. But the plan still seems like a good one. You accept the deal, and you continue to cooperate until she wins the game.

After the game, you wonder what went wrong, and whether you could have played better. You decide that there was no better way to deal with your girlfriend's "finger-slip" - after all, the plan you enacted gave you maximum possible utility under the circumstances. But you wish that you'd pre-committed, at the beginning, to saying "I will punish finger slips equally to deliberate defections, so make sure you're careful." Alternatively, you could have agreed to the deal, and then performed an identical "finger slip" several turns later.

But then, you're not really annoyed too much - she's always in a *great* mood after beating you at Ludo.

## 2. The Late Assignment

You are a perfectly utilitarian NIT Rourkela professor `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` who attaches exactly the same weight to the students' welfare as your own. *Hey, this is a story - I can make theoretical assumptions!* You need to have the assignments of all sixty students in your 3<sup>rd</sup> year Engineering class by the time midsemester grades go out on the 1<sup>st</sup> of March.

You don't want to have to work during the exam time, so you set a deadline that all reports must be in by February 14<sup>th</sup> or you won't grade them and the students will fail the class. *Yup, no ulterior motives here*.

Oh, and your class is an Open Elective - Human Resources Management, and as part of a running class project all your students have to behave as selfish utility-maximizing agents for the semester.

The rules are as follows:

* It costs your students 0 utility to turn in the report on time, but they gain +1 utility by turning it in late (assuming they enjoy procrastinating). 
* It costs you 0 utility to grade a report turned in before February 14<sup>th</sup>, but -30 utility to grade one after February 14<sup>th</sup>.
* Students get 0 utility from having their reports graded on time, but get -100 utility from having a report marked incomplete and failing the class.

If you say "There's no penalty for turning in your report after deadline." then the students will procrastinate and turn in their reports late, for a total of +50 utility (1 per student times fifty students). You will have to grade all fifty reports during Exam time, for a total of -1800 utility (-30 per report times 60 reports). Total utility is -1750.

So instead you say "If you don't turn in your report on time, I won't grade it." All students calculate the cost of being late, which is +1 utility from procrastinating and -100 from failing the class, and turn in their reports on time. You get all reports graded before the exams, no students fail the class, and total utility loss is zero. Yay!

However, an outgoing student meets you after class on February 15<sup>th</sup>, a day after the deadline, and says "Sorry, I was really busy yesterday (*Of course she was e.e*), so I couldn't come all the way here to hand in my report. I expect you'll grade my report anyway, because I know you to be a perfect utilitarian who attaches exactly the same weight to the students' welfare as your own (again, this is a story), and you'd rather take the -30 utility hit to yourself than take the -100 utility hit to me."

You respond "Sorry, but if I let you get away with this, all the other students will turn in their reports late in the summer." 

She says "Tell you what - our institute has procedures for changing a student's previously given grade. If I ever do this again, or if I ever tell anyone else about this, you can change my grade to a fail. Now you know that passing me this one time won't affect anything in the future. It certainly can't affect the past. So you have no reason not to do it."

You believe her when she says she'll never tell. But you say "You made this argument because you believed me to be the sort of person who would accept it. In order to prevent other people from making the same argument, I have to be the sort of person who wouldn't accept it. To that end, I'm going to not accept your argument."

### **Corollaries:** 

1. **The Grieving Student**

A second student comes to you and says "Sorry I didn't turn in my report yesterday. My mother died the other day, and I wanted to go to her funeral."

You say "Like all Humanities professors in this institute, I have no soul, and so am unable to sympathize with your loss. Unless you can make an argument that would apply to all rational actors in my position, I can't grant you an extension."

She says "If you did grant this extension, it wouldn't encourage other students to turn in their reports late. The other students would just say 'He got an extension because his mother died'. They know they won't get extensions unless they kill their own mothers, and even Engineering students aren't *that* evil. Further, if you don't grant the extension, it won't help you get more reports in on time. Any student would rather attend their mother's funeral than pass a course, so you won't be successfully motivating anyone else to turn in their reports early."

You think for a while, decide he's right, and grant him an extension on his report.

2. **The Engagement**

A third student comes to you and says "Sorry I didn't turn in my report yesterday. It was Valentine's Day yesterday, and my girlfriend proposed to me. But don't worry! Valentine's Day only occurs once a year, and everyone knows that most Engineering students don't even have a social life. You'll probably never see a student with this exact excuse again. So in a way, it's not that different from the student here just before me, the one whose mother died."

You respond "It may be true that very few Engineering students will be able to say both that they have an actual social life, and that their girlfriend proposes on the day before the report comes due. But by accepting your excuse, I establish a precedent of accepting excuses that are approximately this good. And there are many other excuses approximately as good as yours. Maybe someone's a big soap opera fan, and the season finale is on the night before the deadline. Maybe someone loves rock music, and there's a big rock concert on. Maybe someone's brother flies from outside the country to visit them that week. Practically anyone can come up with an excuse as good as yours, so if I accept your late report, I have to accept everyone's."

"The student who was here before you, that's different. We, as a society, already have an ordering in which a family member's funeral is one of the most important things around. By accepting his excuse, I'm establishing a precedent of accepting any excuse approximately that good, but almost no one will ever have an excuse that good. Maybe a few people who are really sick, someone struggling with a drug addiction or a loved one's suicide, that kind of thing. Not the hordes of people who will be coming to me if I give you your exemption."

That evening, you wonder if you should change the grading methodology such that the penalty for missing the deadline for assignments is a curve rather than a cliff - each day of delay would cost some percentage of the grade. But nah, that would be too much of a hassle. You sleep well at night, patting yourself on the back for being such a fair and utilitarian authority figure. And besides, the first student was remarkable in exactly the right ways, and you were looking forward to having her in your class again next semester.

## 3. The Disciplinary Action

You are one of the two student representatives of NIT Rourkela's ISDC (Institute Standing Disciplinary Committee), affectionately dubbed as the *DisCo*. 

The case standing before you is an MTech student who reportedly assaulted another student in the campus library. He pleads his case:

"I am dating a wonderful and beautiful BTech girl who I love very much. However, I found her making out with a clubmate of hers in the library. In a fit of rage, I grabbed a nearby hardcover copy of Perry's Handbook of Chemical Engineering, and hit him over the head with it, knocking him out. (It's a pretty big book). I plead that you let me go free. Our institute needs to expel assaulters, as a general rule. After all, they are dangerous people who cannot be allowed to walk free. However, I only hit that guy because he was making out with my girlfriend. In my place, anyone would have done the same. So the crime has no bearing on how likely I am to murder someone else. I'm not a risk to anyone who isn't making out with my girlfriend, and after this incident I plan to break up with her and live the rest of my days a bachelor, like the other MTech students. Therefore, you have no need to deter me from future assaults, and can safely let me go free."

You respond to the fellow student: "You make a convincing argument, and I believe that you will never assault anyone else in the future. However, other people will one day be in the position you were in, where they walk in on their partners cheating on them. Society needs to have a credible pre-commitment to punishing them if they succumb to their rage, in order to deter them from assault."

"No," says the defendant, "I understand your reasoning, but it won't work. If you've never walked in on your boyfriend making out with another girl, you can't possibly understand the rage. No matter how bad the deterrent was, you'd still assault the girl."

You take a quick look at your own boyfriend, who is the other student representative of the ISDC and isn't meeting your eyes. "I'm afraid I just can't believe anyone could ever be quite that irrational. But I see where you're coming from. I'll give you a lighter sentence and recommend that you be suspended for three weeks instead of being expelled."

## 4. The MUN Dictator

You are attending the prestigious NIT Rourkela International Model United Nations, attracting over 200 student delegates from around the country.

You are assuming the role of a dictator from East Exampleia, a newly formed republic subsisting largely off its main export, high quality hypothetical scenarios. You've always had it in for your ancestral enemy, West-Examplestan, but the MUN has made it clear that any country in your region that aggressively invades a neighbor will be severely punished with sanctions and possible enforced "regime change." So you decide to leave the West alone for the time being.

In the given MUN-scenario, a few West Examplestanis unintentionally wander over your unmarked border while prospecting for new scenarios to mine. 

You immediately declare it a "hostile incursion" by "West Examplestani spies", declare war, and take the Western capital in a sneak attack.

Almost instantly, the MUN Secretary-General is at your table, and he sounds angry. "I thought we at the MUN had made it perfectly clear that countries can't just invade each other anymore! Those times are behind us now that the veto powers have a great head start by doing the exact same thing in the past."

"But didn't you read our propaganda mouthpi...ahem, official newspaper? We didn't just invade. We were responding to Western aggression!"

"Hogwash!" says the MUN Secretary-General. "Those were a couple of lost scenario prospectors, and you know it!"

"Well," you say. "Let's consider your options. The MUN needs to make a credible pre-commitment to punish aggressive countries, or everyone will invade their weaker neighbors. And you've got to follow through on your threats, or else the pre-commitment won't be credible anymore. But you don't actually like following through on your threats. Invading rogue states will kill a lot of people on both sides and be politically unpopular, and sanctions will hurt your economy and lead to heart-rending images of children starving. What you'd really like to do is let us off, but in a way that doesn't make other countries think they'll get off too."

"Luckily, we can make a credible story that we were following international law. Sure, it may have been stupid of us to mistake a few prospectors for an invasion, but there's no international law against being stupid. If you dismiss us as simply misled, you don't have to go through the trouble of punishing us, and other countries won't think they can get away with anything."

"Nor do you need to live in fear of us doing something like this again. We've already demonstrated that we won't go to war without a *casus belli*. If other countries can refrain from giving us one, they have nothing to fear."

The MUN Secretary-General doesn't believe your story, but the countries that would bear the economic brunt of the sanctions and regime change decide they believe it just enough to stay uninvolved.

You feel pretty smug about yourself, and decide to hit on the West Examplestani delegate during the Social Evening. She was making doe eyes at you the whole time, and the victory would only taste that much sweeter.
